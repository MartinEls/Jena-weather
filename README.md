# Jena weather data (BGC 2004-today)

The processed dataset can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinelstner/jena-weather-data-bgc-2004-today).

Various weather data logged at 10min intervals by the Max-Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (BGC) in Jena. Current readings and more details are available on the station's homepage. Details on the hardware setup and general measurement technique are provided in this report

A subset of this dataset is used in Francois Chollet's Deep Learning with Python in chapter 10. I recollected the updated dataset to rerun the analysis from the book.
